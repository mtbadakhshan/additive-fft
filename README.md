Additive Fast Fourier Transforms over Finite Fields

## To-do:
1. Implement the FFT and IFFT algorithms for Cantor's algorithm in Sage
1. Implement the FFT and IFFT algorithms for Gao's algorithm in Sage 
1. Make `S_shifts_table_generator` function faster in the pre computations in the Cantor's algorithm using the fact that $S_{i+k}(y_k) = y_i$.
